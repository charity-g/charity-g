Hey, I'm Charity!

I'm here building to understand and solve interesting and difficult problems.

If you look at my projects, I can guarantee that I can explain each line of code. Why?

- Founding SWE @ Xpress Select → I got to take full ownership of the entire software. Iterated with AI but still managed to review and approve each line of deployed code, and I had to think about resilience, redundancy, availability and customer impact at a scale fit for B2B platforms. Regularily identified bugs in < 5 minutes because of codebase depth.
- Software Engineer Intern @ Amgen -> 
- Data Engineer Intern @ STEMCELL Technologies →



sincerely,
