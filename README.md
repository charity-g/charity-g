Hey, I'm Charity!

I'm here building to understand and solve interesting and difficult problems.

When I own a project, I can explain each line of code. Challenge me on this, I'll guarantee it. 

Why?
- Founding SWE @ Xpress Select → I got to take full ownership of the entire software. Iterated with AI but still managed to review and approve each line of deployed code, and I had to think about resilience, redundancy, availability and customer impact at a scale fit for B2B platforms.
- Data Engineer Intern @ STEMCELL Technologies → Work ethic + action >>> talk. Tackled brand new data warehouse systems with automatation. Pushed for ideas and project implementationsand ran 30,000 SQL queries.
- Computational Co-lead @ UBC Biomolecular Design Team (BIOMOD) → Showing up is everything. Went from never having wetlab experiments but still coordinated logistics for ordering, APIs and managed to deploy, proofread and format 50 pages of final competition paper write-ups. 

sincerely, 
<br>
Charity
