✨ hey, i'm charity! 

I have a passion of seeing through the entire data pipeline, from data extraction to transformation to ultimately ensure the data is reliable and consistent for the end-user, be it business decision-making analytics or secure and reliable user access. I've already had 2 years of experience in different internships and projects designing, building, and optimizing data pipelines, and am looking forward to tackling more challenges like these in the future!
